<span id="date">Report 5 10/25/2024</span><br><br><br><br>Hello again! Sorry this took so long to get out. I have been punished for my idleness concerning this website by having lots of blessings and a very poor memory to write them all! For example: My dear SMLs (which is for Service Mission Leader, they are sort of like a Mission Presidant) have been released. So, durring the Service zone missionary conference in Springfield MO, we had to say goodbye to them and I wrote a lot about it in my journal because they welcomed me in the mission and immiediatly they reminded me of my grandparents, both maternal and paternal. So, it was sad to see them go! But, I knwo that the Lord has somethign in sotre for them. For Sister and Elder Jarvis--if you are reading this I love you guys very much! THank you for everything. One cool thing was that they gave me a priesthood vial for consecrated oil that was specially designed with the Christus statue engraved on it!<br><br>I have been able to annoint for a blessing of health for the sick and afflicted already! I feel like I become more and more a sharper and better tool in the hands of our Lord Jesus Christ as time goes on and I follow spiritual promptings. For example, today my family went to the St. Louis Missouri Temple. It was the first time that I was able to take a name to my local temple, it was a very spiritual experience and I would love to testify to you that the Temple of the House of the Lord really IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. That he has walked those halls! He has ordained through his Prophets and Apostles these beutiful temples for the indespensible service that they serve for the Lord Jesus Christ. We gather Isreal on both sides of the veil in the temple. By this, for those that don't know, I mean we do some sacred ordinances that really do bring us closer to God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Ghost! As well as perform these special ordinances like Baptism for those who have passed on. (This is what I meant by "Both sides of the veil".)<br><br>Of course, they have to accept the ordinance, for the Lord won't allow anything that intrudes upon another's agency. It was such a sacred experience, and through these ordinances and holy Covenants we make with God, we can becoem mroe like Jesus Christ and unite our families for all time and eternity!<br><br><br><br>After the amazing Temple trip, my family was making the long 3 1/2 hour drive home--a thought came into my head that was probably inspired or maybe Jesus Christ just took advantage of my silly Technology thought. This thought was too visit the local computer store called Best Buy while we were in St. Louis! The Laptop I am writing on won't last forever (It is already almost 4 years old) and I would need another one for my service at the Global Service Department...So, I just wanted to go window shopping. Little did I know that we had a Best Buy in Springfield MO, and so my family decided to go to Springfiled so we could go visit Tali! (Though deep in my brain and my mortal heart of man....I wanted to go to the computer store in Springfield!) However, along the way to my sister Tali's brand new apartment was a Walmart where I was able to run into a poor homelessman. I don't know if he was actually homeless, but I was able to help him because I just-out-of-the-blue waved to him and told him to have a good day. He saw my Missionary tag and replied "God bless you!" then I was able to help him and told him that our Church would offer finiancial help, so I wrote the Church's Website on a ten dollar bill and gave it to him! It was quite a blessed experience, and the Holy Spirit enlightened me with a thought:<br><br><br><br>"You are the face of the Church to the community"<br><br><br><br>So, I smiled.
