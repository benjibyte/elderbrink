<span id="date">Record 6 11/21/2024</span>Guess what! Today at the Library, they finally let me shelve books! I had to be trained by one of the head staff specifically because it was so important. I have been shelving the DVDs and the Audiobooks for a while now, but I was very glad to do something that felt more "librarian-ish." <br><br>I first recieved this news when I was presented with my very own library cart! It felt so wonderful to feel like I had earned their trust. I will admit, however, that while I was gathering holds I couldn't help but lean a little on it and push it around very fast! It was so fun and felt so stirdy. I was also able to arrive earlier than I ever have to the library, almost a whole hour before it opened up! So, I ogt an extra hour of service under my belt for the day, plus--it was quite interesting to help open the Library. It looked very different when all the lights were off!<br><br><br><br>Unfortunately, the GSD isn't quite so interesting to read about, but I get to share my testimony there a lot more often, which I, as a Full-Time Service Missionary, really appreacate. Recently, we realesed the latest version of the Church's Member Tools app, 5.1.2, which unbeknownst to us until after the update, has some "Login" issues with everyone's default browser on their devices. We wanted to incorporate a built-in miniture website-like browser for the Sign-In process on Member Tools, but that had on accidentally made conflicts with the actual browser on most people's phones! So, as you can imagine it was up to us, the Member Tools REsponse Team, to help the memberso f the church learn how to navigate this new issue. Then, if there are any remaining problems we can't solve, we escalate them to the Development Team that actually makes the app. (I hope to someday be a part of this team!)<br><br>
Also, tomarrow is my 3 month anniversay of being a missionary! Yay!
