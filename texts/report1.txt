<span id="date">1st Report 9/7/24</span><br><br><br><br>Alright! Here is my first report<br><br>So this week, I was able to serve at both the Library in West Plains Missouri, and at the Global Service Department for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! (For that latter service opportunity, it's mostly customer service and very minor IT work, I hope to get promoted to the Church's App Development team someday!)<br><br><br><br>At the Library, I am to wear street clothes, or as my teaching-missionary counterparts call them: P-day clothes! I don't really call them P-day clothes because service missionaries are supposed to schedule something called "agency hours" which are very different depending on the individual service missionary. For example, when I'm done serving at the Library I might draw for an hour or program for an hour. (I love programming and I spent a large chunk of this morning coding up this website!) Then after that hour is over I move on to the next thing I put in for my schedule.<br><br><br><br>However, while at the Library, the rules become more strict (as they always do when I'm on an *appointed* service assignment) and I am not allowed to listen to music at the library as I need to pay my utmost attention to what I'm doing and keep an ear or eye out for the Holy Ghost's promptings. I have had 4 wonderful experiences at the library.<br><br>The first one comes from my very first day at the library and it was actually last week.<br><br><br><br>I was learning how to shelve rented DVDs and audiobooks (Playaways, basically they are mini mp3 players but just for books), and an old lady librarian--let's name her Sally (I'm not allowed to divulge people's name without their consent), had asked me some questions about my church! I got intensely excited and really nervous! Service missionaries don't have lessons from a book called: "Preach My Gospel" to go by, just our wits, gospel-of-Jesus-Christ knowledge, and the Holy Ghost!<br><br><br><br>Sally wanted to know if people were forced to go on missions at my age or if it was entirely optional. In that moment I remembered (The Holy Spirit likely brought it to mind) something that my Mother and Father and reminded me that morning: <br><br><br><br>"Remember Elder, to involve Jesus Christ! Because he is at the center of everything. Most people down here in the Bible Belt know who he is already!"<br><br><br><br>That was mostly paraphrased but still; So here I was squatting down trying to recite my alphabet to put audiobooks in the correct order on their respective shelves and my supervising librarian asked me a question about missions. I told her after a bit of thought and trying to listen to the Holy Spirit, that Jesus Christ through the revelations given to living prophets commands all young men that it is our Priesthood duty to go forth and serve missions. We aren't forced, but it is doctrine that it is our duty. For young women, it is completely optional, though a wonderfully blessed, decision if they want to serve a mission.<br><br><br><br>I then told Sally my opinion that in the 20s of everyone's life (which are very formative years btw), that I couldn't think of any better decision than to go serve as Jesus would. <br><br><br><br>I then motioned to the whole Library building that we were in and said: "Even as if he were here! Serving in this Library!" I think she liked that a lot.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My other experience has to do with an old friend of a friends of whom I didn't recognize at all but because he saw my BYU–I shirt that I wore that morning he had asked me if I knew a kid that once lived in Willow Springs Missouri, and that played Tennis. Nobody came immediately to mind until that man was able to remember the name.<br><br><br><br>Once he remembered the name, my eyes felt like they lit up and we were able to have a very productive conversation about Christian Missions and BYU. (This was this week btw, and I was sweeping the library street's leaves off the sidewalk).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>My last two experiences from the Library are to do with a different old man. A complete stranger at first, but now a dear friend, except that I do not know his name. I had been on my way to the Library one morning to serve there as a volunteer as I do every Tuesday and Thursday, and to my surprise the Library was locked! Sitting on a bench near the front doors, and old man who I had seen talking on the phone to somebody earlier said: <br><br><br><br>"Sorry young Man, they only open at 9 AM"<br><br><br><br>Of course I knew this, having grown up constantly visiting the Library. However I had lost track of time and didn't realize that I had come an hour early! So I looked around and found a bench. Almost instantly, the Holy Ghost mentioned that I should have sat down by him and talked to him.<br><br><br><br>I immediately felt guilty but pushed it down because I knew that I had an<br><br>hour's worth of scripture study that<br><br>I could get done in the time it took<br><br>for the library to open! You know that as soon as I opened those scriptures, God prompted more strongly to my mind, that I was his (Jesus Christ's) representative, and <br><br>talking to a poor lonely old man was what the Savior would do!<br><br><br><br>I wrote in my journal that I had hoped I would get a second chance, and then kept on studying my scriptures. To tell the truth, I was overhearing the old man's conversation so I was really multi-tasking, but before I could get the <br><br>courage to go and talk to him.<br><br>here he comes! He congratulates me for focusing on my work instead of coming to talk to him. I told him thank you, and he asked me where I was from. (I wasn't wearing my BYU–I shirt, so he didn't assume I was from Idaho.) We had a nice conversation about the weather and studying. He told me that he was talking to his older brother on the phone and that sometimes they would talk to each other back and forth.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>He soon walked away, and I finished my study to go and serve at the Library that day. Then the next time I served at the Library--Here I come on purpose to see if can catch that old man again and get his name (I didn't though), and there he was! And Before I could Say "Hi," he waved at me and we greeted each other again. He asked me How I was doing, so I asked him that same question and we were both doing very good. I told him that I liked studying at the Library and before our conversation could go on, my Manager (but not Sally) comes through the Door a half hour early and asks me to come on in. The old man seems to know how my library manager is, and asks him what he wanted with me. Then the old man find out that I am a volunteer at the Library, To which the old man says: <br><br>"Well, don't you worry Manager! I've run the background check on this young man, and he is clean as a slate!"<br><br>He then looks at me and whispers:<br><br>"If He ever gives you too much trouble, just tell me and I'll take care of it okay?!"<br><br><br><br>My Manager and I laugh at this and I began another long and tedious but joyful day of service at the Library.<br><br>Feeling that I have not sown seeds, but tilled the ground for seeds to be sown...but perhaps...a few seeds fell out of the pouch. <br><br><br><br>I felt like a successful Service Missionary and a good representative of Jesus Christ!<br><br><br><br><br><br>P.S. Wow, this report got long! I don't really know how to write short reports without omitting several important details. But I will save the GSD experiences in Report 2. I hope you all enjoyed! <br><br><br><br>~ Elder Brinkerhoff
